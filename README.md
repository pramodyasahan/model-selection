# Model Selection Repository

## Overview
The "Model Selection" repository is dedicated to exploring and comparing different regression models for predicting continuous outcomes. This repository includes implementations and evaluations of five key regression models: Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The primary goal is to demonstrate how each model works, evaluate their performance using R-squared values, and guide users in selecting the best model for a given dataset.

## Models Included
1. **Multiple Linear Regression:** A regression technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
2. **Polynomial Regression:** An extension of linear regression, where the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.
3. **Decision Tree Regression:** A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions to model decisions and their possible consequences.
4. **Random Forest Regression:** An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time to output a more accurate prediction.
5. **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** A type of support vector machine that supports linear and non-linear regression.

## Dataset
- The repository utilizes a generic dataset named `Data.csv` for model training and evaluation. Users can replace this dataset with their own to test different scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Model Implementation:** Each regression model is implemented in a clear and understandable manner.
- **Performance Evaluation:** The models are evaluated based on their R-squared values, providing insights into their accuracy and fit.
- **Comparison:** The repository allows for easy comparison between different regression models on the same dataset.

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Replace `Data.csv` with your dataset or use the existing one.
- Run each model script to train and evaluate on your data.
- Compare the R-squared values to determine the best model for your specific dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib (for visualization)
